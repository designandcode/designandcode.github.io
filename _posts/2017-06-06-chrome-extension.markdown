## DOMCapture - Chrome Extension

To solve a common problem I have online I am creating a Google Chrome Extension called *DOMCapture*. 
When activated, the extension will update the page to show all the DOM nodes that can be captured
as a screenshot. Here are screenshots of early development version.

### Page without plugin activated
![Alt text]({{ '/img/domcapture_early1.png' }})

### Page with plugin activated
![Alt text]({{ '/img/domcapture_early2.png' }})

### Clicking on camera screenshots the node
![Alt text]({{ '/img/domcapture_early3.png' }})

### It worked!
![Alt text]({{ '/img/domcapture_early4.png' }})

### Remove plugin artifacts
![Alt text]({{ '/img/domcapture_early5.png' }})
